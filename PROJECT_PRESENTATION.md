# Tube Enthusiast Kata

This weeks task was to create a CodeWars style Kata, similar to a low level kyu, to be shared amongst our fellow cohort members. We was advised to use Vitest, to conduct the tests, so that the users could complete the challenge, upon succesfully passing the tests.

# Ideation

After a brief discussion amongst my team members, we all agreed upon a London Underground theme for the task. My idea was to utlisise the actual names of the tube stations, specifically looking for similarities and in this case, the first letter of the station name.

# The Challenge

You are a London Underground enthusiast and you need to write a function, that will show the first letter, of the most commonly used first letter, for all the underground stations.
