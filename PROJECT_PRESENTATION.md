# Tube Enthusiast Kata

This weeks task was to create a CodeWars style Kata, similar to a low level kyu, to be shared amongst our fellow cohort members. We was advised to use Vitest, to conduct the tests, so that the users could complete the challenge, upon successfully passing the tests.

# Ideation

After a brief discussion amongst my team members, we all agreed upon a London Underground theme for the task. My idea was to utlisise the actual names of the tube stations, specifically looking for similarities and in this case, the first letter of the station name.

# The Challenge

Write a function that takes a list of London Underground station names and returns the most common first letter among all the station names. If there is a tie, return the first letter that appears alphabetically first.
